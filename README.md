# UC Berkeley CS61A - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs 
(Fall 2018 coursework)

CS 61A covers a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, including functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming. The class concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware. The class teaches about programming in general, rather than about one particular programming language.

CS 61A primarily uses the Python 3 programming language. Two other languages are also explored in the course: the Scheme programming language and the Structured Query Language (SQL).
