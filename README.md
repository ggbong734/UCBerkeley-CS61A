# UC Berkeley CS 61A - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs 
*(Fall 2018 coursework)* 
Instructor: John DeNero

CS 61A covers a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, including functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming. 

The class concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware. 

CS 61A primarily uses the **Python 3** programming language. The **Scheme** programming language and the Structured Query Language (**SQL**) are explored in the latter half of the course. The course enables students to self-study by employing the use of the [OK autograder](https://okpy.org/) for coding assignments and projects.
