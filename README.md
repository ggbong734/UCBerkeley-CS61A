# UC Berkeley CS 61A - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs 
(Fall 2018 coursework)

CS 61A covers a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, including functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming. The class concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware. 

CS 61A primarily uses the Python 3 programming language, with Scheme programming language and Structured Query Language (SQL) explored in the latter half of the course.
