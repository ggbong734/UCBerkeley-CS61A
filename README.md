# UC Berkeley CS 61A - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs 
(Fall 2018 coursework)

CS 61A covers a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, including functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming. The class concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware. 

CS 61A primarily uses the Python 3 programming language; the Scheme programming language and the Structured Query Language (SQL) are explored in the latter half of the course. The course employs the OK autograder for homework, labs, and projects which enables students to self-study.
