# UCBerkeley-CS61A-Fall2018
The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science, with particular emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer's point of view.

CS 61A concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware. The class teaches about programming, not about how to use one particular programming language. In particular, the course covers a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, including functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming.

CS 61A primarily uses the Python 3 programming language. Two other languages are also explored in the latter half of the course: the Scheme programming language and the Structured Query Language (SQL).
